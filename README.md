# programingClass

This is a public repo for my programing class.  

Please don't push to this if you are not in the class.

Each student should create their own branch.

The instructor's branch is "sandy".
The sandy branch may not be ready for students to
view so it should not be used by any students.

The master branch will contain answers to assignments which will 
be merged from the sandy branch when it is time for class to begin.
Students should only check into their own branch and merge from
the master branch.

The master branch can be used to find answers.

## Structure:

At the root are project named directories prefaced with a number 
to naturally order them.  

Within each named directory are numbered subdirectories marking the lesson #.

Proceed through the class via the numbered
project directorys and through the numbered lesson sub-directories 
in order.

Within these numbered directories, you will find an assignment.md and students should put their answers into the same directory.
Each lesson within the named project directory builds up on the project
a little at a time.

The master branch will contain the teacher's answers
for reference or help if you are not understanding 
how to proceed.

Answers to the master branch will not be checked in till assignments
are expected to be completed by the students.  Students can later
on pull in the master answers after each lesson so that the subsequent
lesson can build on the previous lesson's answers.
```
Answers are typically code files.
