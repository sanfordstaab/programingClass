# Dialog Assignment 2
- [1] Use the MsgBox.js file as a component to demonstrate the ways
to use it.
Create an input textarea control that the user can edit.
Add buttons for showing 
  - the old built-in alert dialog
  - the old built-in confirm dialog
  - the MsgBox.alert dialog
  - the MsgBox.confirm dialog
  - the MsgBox.warning dialog
  - the MsgBox.stdDlg dialog
Use appropriate css classes to make the dialogs different.
The stdDlg call dialog should contain a test input control that the user
can edit and whatever is in that control should be returned as the result
of the dialog.
Note that you will have to create a new \<dialog\> element for the stdDlg
dialog to meet this criteria and a special onclick handler for the ok button.
You can start this new \<dialog\> element by copying from the alert one.
In all dialog cases show the return value in the spnResult control innerText.
For the alert dialogs just clear the spnResult.innerText value to ''.

This is quite tricky as it does many async calls and you must fully
understand how the MsgBox class works - which is the purpose of this
lesson.
See if you can come up with any suggested improvements to the MsgBox 
class that might make it even easier to use and figure out.
