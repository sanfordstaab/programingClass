Write a program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence from 1 to 20000.
Fibonacci numbers are calculated by adding the previous 2 numbers to find the next one.
So...
0 + 1 = 1
1+1 - 2
1+2=3
2+3 = 5
3+5=8
...

As you calculate each number print out that number using console.log() and the ratio of the last number / the previous number:

ie it should look like this:
1 1
2 2
3 .1.5  (= 3/2)
5  1.66666 (=5/3)
