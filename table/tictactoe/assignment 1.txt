Create your own branch to make your changes to the programmingClass repo:
cd c:\repos\programmingClass
git status
git pull github master
(if you get an error here, let me know)
git branch -C <yourFirstName>
git switch <yourFirstName>
git status
(should be up to date, if not do a git pull github <yourFirstName>
This will set you up with your own branch so you can make changes to these files independently of mine.
Just work in your branch and check in your changes using VSCode or git.
git add .
git commit -m "your commit message goes here"
git push github <yourFirstName>
Go into the table folder and edit the table.html file with VSCode
Remove the buttons and their event handlers and just hardcode the table to use the tic-tac-toe class.
Make the tic tac toe table have empty strings (use: &nbsp; if you like)
Add an onclick event handler for each <td> cell of the table - you can use a single handler and the "event" parameter to identify the ID of the cell.
In the event handler, get the ID of the cell from the event parameter and use it to place an X in that cell but only if that cell is empty.  You can read or write the innerText property of the cell element to do this.
You should now be able to click on any square within the tic-tac-toe table and see an X appear in that cell.
Check in your changes to your local git repository.
push them to github
git push github master

Let me know if you get stuck.  Use screenshots to help me see what your problem is.
