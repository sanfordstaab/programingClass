To catch up to me, do this:
<<<<<<< HEAD
cd <your repos directory\programmingClass 
git pull origin master
git switch <your branch>
git pull origin
git merge master assignment3.html
copy assignment3.html assignment4.html
git add .git commit -m "start on assignment 4"
git push
Avery and I managed to finish the game using a simple random choice for the computer.
Here's what to do (only edit assignment4.html):
Look at the code in assignment4.html and understand it.  
Feel free to use the debugger and trace through each line so you understand what is going on.  
Ask if you are stuck or have any Questions feel free to email me.You will be editing the makeAMove() function.
Change the choice algorithm to favor these points in order:
Empty squares that will win the game if played Empty squares that will prevent the opponent from winning on the next move.
Empty squares that will create 2 in a row for the computerAny random empty square.

This will be challenging but there are no new types of code you will need.  
Just loops and tests.
Don't get distracted on other things, just solve this problem.
When you are done check in like this:
<<<<<<< HEAD
git add .git commit -m "assignment4"

git add .
git commit -m "assignment4"
