Programming:
So far we have completed the checkForWin() function but we aren't using it yet.
Alter the call to this function in the eh_onCellClick() function so that if we have 
won we should tell the user "You won!" and show that for 5 seconds, and then reset 
the board to blank for another game.  You should add an <h1> tag below the board 
table and set or clear its innerText as needed and use setTimeout() to call the 
code to erase the win message and clear the table for another game.

Write another function called checkForLoss() which works just like checkForWin 
but looks for 0s instead of Xs.  You may want to do some refactoring to minimize 
duplicate code here.

We will call this after the computer makes its move by inserting a 0 in an empty space.
We won't be able to test checkForLoss() until we can do the computer's move and we
will work on that in class next week.

Ask yourself this question: "Is there a better way to do this than how we did 
it on our first try?"  See if you can come up with some other ways to check 
for a win or a loss perhaps using different data structures.

Remember to work on your own branch and start by copying the ticTacToe.html 
into the file assignment2.html and work on that file.

I will check my answer into the master branch shortly before our next class.

Bonus assignment:  
  Modify your checkForWin/Loss function(s) so that they return which cells 
  are the winning 3-in-a-row and modify the table to make those marks RED 
  instead of BLACK.
